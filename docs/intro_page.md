# Sustainable Mobility in the Upper Rhine Region
## Data Board of the Indicator Framework for selected test cities

This board is designed to inspect, compare, validate the latest results of the indicator system to make (sustainable) mobility measureable from remote data. The results are limited to 35 municipalities in the study area of the Upper Rhine region.

**For the further development it is important for us to get your feedback, ideas and questions. You can contact us via email.**

Here, on the start page, you find some information about the usability of the board and by scrolling down some basic data describing the test municipalities.

### What can you do on the board?
Via the left sidebar you have the possibilty to select different views. These views are available:
- **info**: you are here right now. You find information how to use the board and some general data describing the test municipalities in terms of population and area.
- **cities**: on this page you can select cities of interest and compare the indicators in polar plots. You have to views available: (1) one plolar plot per city or (2) a single polar plots for all slected cities. By default the cities Strasbourg, Basel, Colmar, Karlsruhe and Freiburg im Breisgau are selected.
- **indicators**: as default you find a visualization of all indicators and cities ('all'). You can then select an indicator of interest and will see a visualization of all its subindicators. You have the possibility to uncheck individual subindicators in exclude them from the visualization. All plots can be sorted by the columns shown and the following columns: population, pouplation density, area, urban area.
Additional to the visualization, a short documentation of data sources and  the subindicator computation is provided.
- **subindicators**: on this page you have the possibility to compare arbitrary subindicators across indicator 'boundaries'

### How to use the board?
- the navigation is all in the left sidepanel. the side panel can be hidden by clicking the *x* and extended by clicking the *>*. You will have bigger plots when you hide the panel.
